  # Ideally this step should be the first one, but then it is a bit flakey
  # since the test runner doesn't wait for bootstrap (it just waits for connection),
  # and so by the time we check the state, the state might be busy and not idle.

  # Ideally we wait for bootstrap (and check some output from it, too), but that's
  # for later. For now just moving this step to be the last one.
