# NOTE: it can be seen as a bug (if we want the effective timestamp of the
# misplaced lines to be the same in all queries), but:
#
# - We'd have to check every single line regardless of the pattern, and 2hen we
#   filter out a lot of lines, this adds like 5-10% of overhead, for probably
#   no good reason (accounting for this corner case)
# - Even if we do that, we'd probably also need to communicate that to the
#   client, otherwise the mstats will mismatch the messages. Again, I doubt it's
#   worth for this corner case.
