### Bug Fixes

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0) (2025-04-28)


### Features

* Add support for `journalctl` ([6d7d69](https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/commit/6d7d695ced450e1648994e690dd26a503b4fe034), [1687ee](https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/commit/1687ee728387d838c9ec56d40b3b2a3d9acf7901)). Log files are still preferred, because [they are more reliable](https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/issues/7#issuecomment-2820521885) and [work much faster](https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/issues/7#issuecomment-2823303380), but `journalctl` is more universally available these days, and also often has longer logs history, so it is fully supported now.
* Add support for reading logs with `sudo` ([23a6a4](https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/commit/23a6a4e6b48da8658fcfd0eefb0b2193ba389a13))
* Add `--ssh-config` flag to specify the ssh config location ([3ceb70](https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/commit/3ceb70b803bff5b47e3982b8dd202516d2bbd538))
* **CI:** set up release-please with auto binaries building for releases ([2a9d23](https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/commit/2a9d2353d3050e75d727825c6db86d09229b5d97))

### Bug Fixes

* Fix focus issue when non-last modal is removed ([2e4ff3](https://github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/commit/2e4ff3d35f7e473283b7afe7671d6e0e180d2dac))

## 1.1.0 (2025-04-26)

### Features

* Support keyboard shortcuts `Alt+Left` and `Alt+Right` for navigating
  browser-like history, just as it works in a browser;
* Rename the binary installed with `go install
  github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/cmd/nerdlog@latest` from `nerdlog-tui` to just
  `nerdlog`.

## 1.0.0 (2025-04-22)

### Features

* First release which can be considered a minimal viable product.

  Thereâ€™s still plenty of room for new features, and some minor bug fixes, but
  overall the core functionality is in place and stable enough to be released
  into the wild.
