## 1.1.0 (2025-04-26)

### Features

* Support keyboard shortcuts `Alt+Left` and `Alt+Right` for navigating
  browser-like history, just as it works in a browser;
* Rename the binary installed with `go install
  github.com/dimonomid/nerdlog/cmd/nerdlog@latest` from `nerdlog-tui` to just
  `nerdlog`.

## 1.0.0 (2025-04-22)

### Features

* First release which can be considered a minimal viable product.

  Thereâ€™s still plenty of room for new features, and some minor bug fixes, but
  overall the core functionality is in place and stable enough to be released
  into the wild.
